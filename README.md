This code is not production ready. The goal of this repository is to explore ways to interact in virtual reality, augmented reality, mixed reality (or XR for short) for knowledge work. Consequently the code does not adhere to best practices, is not optimized and has not been refactored. Once some solutions have been identified only then will the code be improved according to the usual criteria. Feel free though to provide pull request directly addressing such concerns but be mindful that the purpose here is to explore broadly.
